Evaluation Function for Minimax Algorithm explaination:
    The evaluation function chosen for the Minimax Algorithm to calculate the utility value for
    depth-limited search and terminal nodes is
        AIScore - player2Score
    where,
        AIScore represents the score of the AI at the particular node.
        player2Score represents the score of the second player.
